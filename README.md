# S&P-500-indicator
Basic insides into the S&P 500. Used the most simple tools out there to use momentum strategies.

**Things To Do**
- Failed to use batch api calls so the functions are very slow.
- Use better library than y-finance, the amount of information is very little.
- Optimize the program to loop the run time to real time price and information
